# DCGAN

In this repository, I have reproduced the DCGAN paper. The paper can be found here: [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
The implementation is done using PyTorch. I have also released pretrained models.
Also, I am publishing a colab notebook, with which you can reproduce the entire model in just one go. And with the help
of the pretrained models, you can also, see amazing results, right in your browser and start playing with it.

## How to use
